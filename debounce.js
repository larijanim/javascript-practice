debouncing is a technique used to control how many times we allow a function to be executed over time. When a JavaScript function is debounced with a wait time of X milliseconds, it must wait until after X milliseconds have elapsed since the debounced function was last called. You almost certainly have encountered debouncing in your daily lives before â€” when entering an elevator. Only after X duration of not pressing the "Door open" button (the debounced function not being called) will the elevator door actually close (the callback function is executed).

Implement a debounce function which accepts a callback function and a wait duration. Calling debounce() returns a function which has debounced invocations of the callback function following the behavior described above.

******Solution ********
Given that there's a wait duration before the function can be invoked, we know that we will need a timer, and setTimeout is the first thing that comes to mind.

We will also need to return a function which wraps around the callback function parameter. This function needs to do a few things:

1) Debounce invocation
It invokes the callback function only after a delay of wait. This is performed using setTimeout. Since we might need to clear the timer if the debounced function is called again while there's a pending invocation, we need to retain a reference to a timeoutID, which is the returned value of setTimeout.
If the function is called again while there's a pending invocation, we should cancel existing timers and schedule a new timer for the delayed invocation with the full wait duration. We can cancel the timer via clearTimeout(timeoutID).
2) Calls the callback function with the right parameters
Debounced functions are used like the original functions, so we should forward the value of this and function arguments when invoking the original callback functions.

You may be tempted to use func(...args) but this will be lost if callback functions are invoked that way. Hence we have use Function.prototype.apply()/Function.prototype.call() which allows us to specify this as the first argument.

func.apply(thisArg, args)
func.call(thisArg, ...args)
